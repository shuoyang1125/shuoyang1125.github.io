Hi! I'm Shuo Yang from the school of Electronics at Peking University. I received my B.E. degree from the school of Information Science and Engineering at Southeast University in 2020. I'm currently pursuing my PhD. degree in Communication and Information Systems. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongbin Li](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/info/1035/1122.htm) and co-advised by [Prof. Chuanchuan Yang](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/info/1048/1216.htm). My research interests mainly focus on computer networks.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
