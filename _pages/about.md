Hi! I'm Shuo Yang from the school of Electronics at Peking University. I received my B.E. degree from the school of Information Science and Engineering at Southeast University in 2020. I'm currently pursuing my PhD. degree in Communication and Information Systems. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongbin Li](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/info/1035/1122.htm) and co-advised by [Prof. Chuanchuan Yang](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/info/1048/1216.htm). My research interests mainly focus on computer networks.
